            As an Eagle Scout, I have always been driven by a commitment to
            serve and help others. This dedication led me to work as a first
            responder from the age of 18 to 21, where I gained invaluable
            experience and honed my problem-solving skills as an EMT-Basic.
            However, my true passion lies in technology, where I see endless
            possibilities to positively impact lives. Transitioning into the
            tech field, I am currently a computer science student at the
            University of North Texas, where I strive to blend my background in
            emergency response with innovative tech solutions.

          <p class="about-me-p2">
            Throughout my academic journey, I have achieved notable milestones
            that underscore my technical proficiency and creative
            problem-solving abilities. I ranked second place at the 2023 NSBE
            Hackathon at the University of North Texas, showcasing my ability to
            collaborate and innovate under pressure. Additionally, I am CompTIA
            A+ certified and have earned a FreeCodeCamp certification in
            Responsive Web Design. My goal is to leverage my skills to develop
            applications that simplify and enhance everyday life, continuing my
            commitment to helping others through technology.
